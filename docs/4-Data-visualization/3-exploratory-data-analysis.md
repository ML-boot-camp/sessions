# Exploratory data analysis

## Data visualization method

1. Analyze data type: analyze the "measurement type" of the data you want to plot
2. Encode data on visuals: choose a set of visual variables adapted to each data, according to their measurement type
3. Confront your subjectivity: make several versions of the plot and choose the best one by discussing it with other people.

## Golden rules

- **Avoid information overload**: don't try to plot more that 3 informations on one plot.
- **Use visual redundancy**: use more than one visual variable per measurement.
- **Never forget zero**: always plot the zero if its meaningful
- **Avoid overplotting**: don't try to plot too much data points on the same plot, at the risk of saturating the visual space. If needed, reduce the number of data points (take a sample) or use transparency.
- **Don't use pie charts**: period.
