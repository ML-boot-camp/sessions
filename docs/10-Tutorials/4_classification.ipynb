    "## 5. Text cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From text reviews to numerical vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training some models, the first step is to transform text into numbers :\n",
    "\n",
    "from\n",
    "```\n",
    "f(raw_text) = rating_classe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to\n",
    "```\n",
    "f(numerical_vector_representing_text) = rating_classe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, we can't direclty feed an algortihm with text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Wow, that beer is SOOOO good :O !!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "must be transformed to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[3, 4, 21, 0, 0, 8, 19]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where the values of the vector contain the meaning of the text. Knowing that the\n",
    "closer texts are in terms of meaning, the more closed their vector representation is\n",
    "too. Moreover, it is often more convenient to convert texts of different sizes into\n",
    "vectors of fixed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Wow, that beer is SOOOO good :O !!\"\n",
    "-> characters : 34\n",
    "-> vector (1x7) : [3, 4, 21, 0, 0, 8, 19]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"This beer is very tasty\"\n",
    "-> characters : 23\n",
    "-> vector (1x7) : [3, 4, 20, 0, 0, 7, 19]\n",
    "```\n",
    "But:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"It's not a beer, just motor oil at best.\"\n",
    "-> characters : 40\n",
    "-> vector (1x7) : [0, 4, 1, 12, 14, 0, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From raw text reviews to clean list of words\n",
    "\n",
    "Before converting text to numerical vector, the first step is to clean the text to\n",
    "keep only the pertinent information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the following cleaning steps that we will apply on the reviews:\n",
    "1. Convert letter to lowercase\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Wow, that beer is SOOOO good :O !!\" -> \"wow, that beer is soooo good :o !!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Remove the punctuation letter to lowercase\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"wow, that beer is soooo good :o !!\" -> \"wow that beer is soooo good\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Transform the text into tokens\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"wow that beer is soooo good\" -> [\"wow\", \"that\", \"beer\", \"is\", \"soooo\", \"good\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Remove the stopwords, the most common english words that often bring noise to the\n",
    "models.\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\"wow\", \"that\", \"beer\", \"is\", \"soooo\", \"good\"] -> [\"wow\", \"beer\", \"soooo\", \"good\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To go further, some techniques can be used to reduce the forms of each word into a\n",
    "common base or root. This can be done with:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) **Stemming** is the process of eliminating affixes (suffixed, prefixes, infixes,\n",
    "circumfixes) from a word in order to obtain a word stem.\n",
    "\n",
    "> am, are, is  $\\Rightarrow$  be\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) **Lemmatization** is related to stemming, differing in that lemmatization is able\n",
    "to capture canonical forms based on a word's lemma.\n",
    "\n",
    "> book, books, book's, book'  $\\Rightarrow$  book\n",
    "\n",
    "_The steps presented here are just the most basic, many different things can be\n",
